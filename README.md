# 2DLD
two dimentions low defintion, was at first going to be a cellular automaton, but i decided expand the project. as of now its a bi-polar (meaning two opposite states) etch and sketch

RUNNING
TO get started you will need to install processing 3
https://processing.org/
once done click open, and select matrix.pde
click the play button and your done!


CONTROLLS
arrow keys: use the arrow keys to move a gray dot around leaving a trail of blackness just dont to out of bounds!
space:invert all the pixels on the screen as of now there is only one color value,
r:randomly color screen, was my first step towards a cellular automaton. could it be yours too?

CONTRIBUTING, 
as of right now, my code is a mess. 
if its been like this for a little bit, please politely ping me on discord and i should get to it (a  rat#3272)(two spaces)
if i like it, i will add it. if I dont like it i might change it to be something you enable/disable in the code, or, ask you to make your own copy of this and add it to that.
CUSTOM LICENCE. 
idk how these work but let me take a shot at it. 
same thing as an mit licence, how ever any edits or new things you add must(if your ok with it i am flexable) be added to the origonal via PR. i will give you credit for your PR's I would just be sad if you Made your own cool version, and then I, or others could not admire/test/tinker withit.
perhaps in a few years there might be celebraty coders names or commits. on the document. It would make me so proud IF this gets hundreds of usernames on it.
```EX:
rect(80,40,80,80); //codechad, 2030/2/12. "woop woop cool note, simular to sign on 2b2t(if that hellpits still around)"
ellipse(20,30,80,80);//eciencs, 2020/9/12 "eciencs wonders what this will bloom into!he also wonders why he chose this usr!" 

luckly git saves all version so if you over right someones user it will still be there.```
